Even then, we don't tend to give up. We break this barrier every time. And keep making progress everyday. But, progress towards what?</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>In this world, we create and things. Solve problems that we created for ourselves. We try to outperform everyone. Currently, there is little to no connection between us. We lack empathy. There is more hatred than love. The greatest of us remain the same while the smaller ones suffer. The love and hate our emotions. We only try to content ourself but not others. We praise and criticize ourself. We never really understand what we are doing.</p>\n<h1>The Uncertainty</h1>\n<p>Ever wondered about it? Nothing that happens in your life is predictable. The least thing you can predict is &quot;change&quot;. Anything that's beyond it, is just out of our hands. And it is what makes life beautiful. All of us certainly know that there's an end to life. But don't know when. The next thing that's going to happen, is uncertain. And it is same for every one of us. Things that happen in our life don't always occur at our wish and will. Our caste, religion, financial status, nothing affects it. Then, why do we do these?</p>\n<h1>The Reason</h1>\n<p>We think that we are smart. We always tend to assume the outcome. This defines the impermanence of humans. It confuses us, makes us overthink. Ending in nothing but a meaningless emotion known as <em>affection</em>. We live for ourself and for our loved ones. And there's no way you can deny it. Life is nothing more than a paradox. It's something that keeps us alive and conscious.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The trail you leave, the impact you create, the effort you send forth is what makes a difference. You need to believe in yourself. Your self-confidence, your self-esteem and your self-motivation is what moves you forward. Keeps you making progress. We don't know how we exist. We don't know why we exist. We don't know what this realm is. We don't know how we are self-aware. But the answer resides deep inside you. No one can teach you this, you cannot learn it by reading. It comes though practice, experience and pain. If you are capable of explaining this, you have the greatest answer of the mankind.</p>\n<h6>References</h6>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/the-ascent/what-are-we-striving-for-as-individuals-and-as-a-human-collective-658a242c2e14\">https://medium.com/the-ascent/what-are-we-striving-for-as-individuals-and-as-a-human-collective-658a242c2e14</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/life-is-full-of-uncertainty-weve-just-got-to-learn-to-live-with-it-30092\">https://theconversation.com/life-is-full-of-uncertainty-weve-just-got-to-learn-to-live-with-it-30092</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-take-on-the-uncertainty-of-life\">https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-take-on-the-uncertainty-of-life</a></li>\n</ul>"}
